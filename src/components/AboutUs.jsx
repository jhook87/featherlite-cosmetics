                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2004, Kim Harvell set out to create natural, truly-clean, safe cosmetics after struggling with
                    problematic skin. Over time, her products evolved but always stayed true to her goal: to create
                    cosmetics that work with your skin, not against it. Today, under the leadership of Tamara Vander
                    Lugt, FeatherLite continues its mission with a new generation of formulas, while honoring Kim's
                    legacy.
